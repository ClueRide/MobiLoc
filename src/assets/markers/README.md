# Marker Icons

Multiple Marker Icons are described here:
- Here I Am icons for showing the user's current position.
- Feature Icons for indicating locations of interest.
The common feature is they live at some location on a map -- which is what makes them a Marker.

## Here I Am markers
There are four icons used depending on two factors:
- Does the device supply a compass heading to show which way the device is facing?
- Is the position generated by the device or does the position come from the server (tethered).

The table below spells this out:

| Compass? | Tethered? | Name |
|-----|-----|-----------------|
| Yes | No  | hereIAm-heading |
| Yes | Yes | hereIAm-heading-tethered |
| No  | No  | hereIAm |
| No  | Yes | hereIAm-tethered |
